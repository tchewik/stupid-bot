HELP

#   option: grab
#   use it only for file splitting, if you have one
#   add your .txt file in the folder and do smth
#   for example
#       $ python3 tchebot.py grab "Елена Чистова" "conversation.txt"
#   so my replics will be added into 'data' file
#   from your conversation
#
#   if you grabbed all your data but bot says he sees nothing,
#   try "question_pack_script.py"
#
#   option: talk
#   use it to talk with bot in command line
#   for example
#       $ python3 tchebot.py talk
